Questions
- What exactly are we looking at? What kind of images and what are we trying to find?
	- does what we are looking for require DNN ? or traditional classifcation ML problem is okay?? 
		- depend on training set data size? what stuff looks like.
	- since DNN blackbox
- Why not use traditional ML classification (k-means...etc)?
